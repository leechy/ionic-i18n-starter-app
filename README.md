# ionic-i18n-starter-app
Almost empty app, where ngx-translate is setted up properly and working.

It's a tabbed Ionic 4.4 (based on Angular 5) project with Settings page,
where one can change the current language and it changes across the whole app.
Three language available (English, Russian and Bulgarian), but it can be easily changed.

In the next revision will add an ngrx store to keep the settings and rest app data there.
